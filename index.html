	    <h1>Fun Friday Website</h1>
		<p>Welcome to the official website! The main purpose of this site is to host the random disposable pages I make for Fun Friday. I find that making a quick webpage is a fast way for me to do certain interactive visual things, so I know that I'll end up with more of these. This is not the same as the project page on the main FLARE145 website.</p>
		<h2>About the series</h2>
		<p>Fun Friday was a weekly video series I did on youttube. It is very hard to say much more than that about it. You can watch it on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwiAx_6OdfcHoDTDEkM-9UbD08-ROpEFl" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FLARE145 YouTube Channel</a>.</p>
		<p>I will likely continue this series with a season 2 in the future, but it is on hiatus for now.</p>
		<h2>Disposable Webpages</h2>
		<p>these are the disposable pages used in my video series.</p>
